It typically means that the `kubectl` autocompletion is not properly set up. Here's how to fix it:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install the `bash-completion` Package üîë

1. **Install the `bash-completion` package:**

   On **Debian/Ubuntu**-based systems, run the following command:

```bash
   sudo apt-get install bash-completion
````

For **Red Hat/CentOS** systems, use:

```bash
sudo yum install bash-completion
```

2. **Load the `bash-completion` configuration:**

   After installation, load the `bash-completion` configuration with the following command:

   ```bash
   source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
   ```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Make Autocompletion Persistent üíæ

To ensure `kubectl` autocompletion is always available, you need to add it to your shell‚Äôs configuration file:

1. **Add the autocompletion command to `~/.bashrc`:**

   Run the following command to make `kubectl` autocompletion persistent across sessions:

   ```bash
   echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Reload your `~/.bashrc` file:**

   To apply the changes, run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
